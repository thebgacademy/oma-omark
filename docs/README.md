## Description

By the end of this session the participant will be able to:

1. Query information on the OMA Browser and navigate OMA's Hierarchical Orthologous Groups.
2. Install and use OMAmer to quickly find the most likely Hierarchical Orthologous Groups for protein sequences.
3. Install and use OMArk to perform quality assessment for a proteome FASTA file, with or without splicing variants.
4. Interpret OMArk quality metrics and the detailed information available in its output.
5. Use the OMArk website to compare quality assessments within a clade.

## Prerequisites

1. Understanding the terms homology, orthology, proteome.
2. Familiarity with linux command line basics (cd, mv, rm, wget, curl etc)
